# Universal Login

Here we get to adjust settings for the universal Auth0 Lock that will provide a bit more of a customized experience to the users at BankZero.  We use their icon and change some color settings to match.

## Settings

Our first step is to select the Experience either "New" or "Classic" is fine for this step, just depends on your needs and look that you would like.
Since it is nice to give some customization, lets use a Company Logo for BankZero as well as change the primary and background colors.

For company logo I've provide you with the png file in this repository, but you may pick what ever you like.  Remember to click save changes at the bottom of your page.

## Authorization extension

We are going to go over [authorization extension](https://github.com/NoelThompson/BankZeroA0/tree/master/Authorization%20Extension) next, which will wrap up our PoC.
