# Enabling Social Provider login

## Connections -> Social
Enabling a social provider login couldn't be easier with Auth0.  The connections section of our UI holds the location where this enablement is done.  Makes sense right?  Your connecting to a familiar provider that holds your profile and Authentication credentials.  Simply navigate your dashboard to the social connections selection and choose a couple of social providers you'd like to use.

For this exercise I naturally chose "Git Hub" and then I also selected "Google".

Enabling simply requires clicking on the slider to move it to green.

## Move on to rules
Since Sign up is so easy with Auth0 (you'll see soon), lets move on and work on our [whitelist](https://github.com/NoelThompson/BankZeroA0/tree/master/Rules).  We want to make sure we set this rule so that BankZero will be able to see how it works.
