# Create users for the BankZero app to use


## Back to the Dashboard

We need get a couple of users created inside our dashboard so that we're able to fulfill one of our requirements of previously signed up users.  Navigate your dashboard to Users & Roles and select users.

Now select Create User:

Fill out the Create User form, supplying a password you'll remember.  Also note the email domain used: examplewidgets.com  
That domain will come up later in this exercise.  Choose what ever you would like for a domain, just keep it in mind.

Create as many users as you'd like.  

## Edit your User

You'll notice that your newly created users shows (pending) under the EMAIL title.

We want to edit this user and verify their e-mail address.  With a working e-mail address the user would simply verify thier existance upon first login by accessing an e-mail sent their address.  In this case we don't have a valid email address and we want to simulate a previously signed up user. *As a side note, you can initiate a send email to verify your newly created users address.  This way, upon verification, they're login experince will be faster*

Simply select "Set email as verified" and click save.
You may also want to Edit the name to personalize this account a bit more.

## What other types of users can I create?

We'll focus on [social provider](https://github.com/NoelThompson/BankZeroA0/tree/master/Social%20Users) logins next.
